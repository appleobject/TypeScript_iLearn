## My Tutorial on TypeScript

- Function
- Classes
- Class Inheritance
- Class Modifiers
- Interface

And a lot more on object oriented programming.

To run a TypeScript

```ts
tsc -w filename.ts
```

To Compile a TypeScript file into a JavaScript file, when you run the first line of code a JS file is compiled at runtime.

```
tsc filename.ts
node filename.js

```

`compilerOptions :{ target:ES6 }`
